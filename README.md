# LearnNodeJSWebDevelopment

## Setup
- I would recommend using GitHub Desktop or a related program for retrieving assingments from GitHub
- I would recommend using VSCode for editing and runnings server
- Install NodeJS from online

## Workflow
- I would suggest forking the repo to your own account then cloning that repo to your own workstation
- You can then begin working on the assignments
- When you are done: commit your work to your repo and do a merge request to get Andrew's attention
